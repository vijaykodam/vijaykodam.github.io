      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I’m <strong>Vijay Kodam</strong>, a seasoned technology professional with deep expertise in Amazon Web Services, cloud architecture, software development, and system design. I currently work as a Principal Engineer in Cloud Technology at Nokia, Finland.</p>
<p>My career journey has been a blend of deep telecom expertise and cutting-edge cloud computing skills. I began by developing software for 2G CDMA systems, progressed to building 3G 1x-EVDO RNC solutions, and then transitioned to deploying 4G/5G Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Telco Cloud using platforms like AWS, containers and Kubernetes. Over the years, I’ve expanded my focus to <strong>Amazon Web Service(AWS), Systems Design, Solution Architecture and Kubernetes</strong>, specializing in Amazon EKS to build scalable and resilient cloud-native solutions for telecom applications.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m leading and executing the end-to-end architecture and migration of a <strong>Private 5G platform</strong> into AWS. This involves designing, implementing, and managing solutions using Amazon EKS, various AWS services, Cassandra, Grafana, Prometheus, and containerized applications. My role encompasses Cloud Architecture, SRE, DevOps, GitOps, and Systems Design, enabling me to deliver robust, scalable, and high-performing cloud-native solutions from start to finish.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I delve into <strong>AI and Large Language Model (LLM)</strong> projects, which are documented in the Projects section of this blog.</p>
<p>The thoughts and opinions shared here are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.</p>
